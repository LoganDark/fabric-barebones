# fabric-barebones

This is a template that I use when starting new mods, it sets up everything that
I need.

- GPLv3 license
- Project code format
- IntelliJ configuration
- Latest Fabric/Minecraft/Yarn versions
- Kotlin
- Renaming is handled by `rebrand.sh`

This allows for extremely rapid development of small mods.

This isn't designed for general use, namely it uses the `net.logandark` package.
But it's public anyway because it might be useful to someone.
